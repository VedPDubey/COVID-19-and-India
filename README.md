<h2>What?</h2>
<h3>A Data Science Project to visualise and predict India's fight against Covid-19</h3>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<h3>The recent surge in cases of covid-19 due to the second wave of the pandemic has created a crisis within the country. This calls for an analysis of how we've been handling the initial wave, how we are doing currently and what we can potentially do in the future. It is also important to make this information accessible to the people and that is what we aim to do.</h3>

<h2>How?</h2>
<h3>It been made possible by working with the data fetched from API's, analyzing it thoroughly, and creating vivid and impactful visualizations that are not only appealing to look at but are also important in drawing inferences from the data. This is has been neatly surmised into a web application with an appealing UI that your average user can use to get a grasp of the situation. We have also integrated a chatbot into our web app that updates the users on location specific pandemic data through simple conversation.</h3>
